You are given 16 cards. The deck is made up of 8 different pairs of cards. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

Each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.


The first time a card is clicked within a game, the game's timer starts to countdown.  The objective is to beat the clock while matching the cards in as few moves as possible.

## The Objective

The objectives are:

1. Match all 16 cards before the game clock runs out.
2. Match all of the cards in as few moves as possible.

## The Rules

1. Each game is timed.  When the time runs out, the game is over.
    - The player's score from previous rounds is retained. 
    - The player does not level up.
2. If the player missed 3 matches in a row, the round ends.
    - The player's score from previous rounds is retained. 
    - The player does not level up.
